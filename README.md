SOCIAL-MEDIA-TEXT-ANALYSIS

Abstract— The significance of text analysis on 
social media has grown in relation to 
comprehending market dynamics, sentiment 
trends, and user behaviour. We provide a fresh 
technique to social media analysis using the 
Streamlit framework and Python in answer to 
this demand. In order to give comprehensive 
answers to the many challenges of social media 
analysis, our system incorporates multiple 
APIs, such as the VADER Sentiment Analysis 
for sentiment evaluation, the PRAW for Reddit 
data extraction, and the Gemini API for 
automated text production and translation. 
Through real-time text correction, sentiment 
analysis, and language translation capabilities, 
our project enables rapid trend analysis, 
sentiment monitoring, and cross-lingual 
communication while offering enterprises, 
researchers, and analyst's useful data.
Keywords— NLP, Emotions, Reddit, Visual, 
Interactions.

I. INTRODUCTION


Because they provide insightful information on 
the beliefs and behaviours of their users, social 
media platforms are excellent sources of data. Our 
project's major goal is to utilize Streamlit and 
Python to the fullest extent possible for social 
media word analysis. Our aim is to equip 
academics and analysts with strong instruments 
for trend research, sentiment monitoring, and 
multilingual communication by merging APIs 
such as VADER Sentiment research and PRAW 
for Reddit data extraction with the Gemini API for 
text production and translation. This research aims 
to improve our knowledge of social media 
dynamics and facilitate wise decision-making for 
various businesses.


The "Social Media Text Analysis" project aims to extract insights from Reddit using advanced NLP for sentiment analysis, auto-generation, and auto-correction. It focuses on understanding user sentiments, generating contextually relevant text, and improving overall content quality to enhance the Reddit user experience.
